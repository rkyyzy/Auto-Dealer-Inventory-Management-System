# Auto Dealer Inventory Management System

## The system that makes data visible

*Auto Dealer Inventory Management System* processes all information that auto dealers could use. 

It is mainly for **second-hand car dealers** to : 
- conveniently store inventory data
- show data analysis

This kind of project attracts me because of its wide usage and extendable complexity. It basically stores useful information but takes effort to make it handy for users.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to browse the list of vehicles in client view and staff view

## Phase 4: Task 2
- Test and design a class in your model package that is robust.  You must have at least one method that throws a checked exception.  You must have one test for the case where the exception is expected and another where the exception is not expected.
- The exception is thrown by updateVin() in Vehicle class to check if the updated VIN is 17 character long or not. It is tested in testUpdateVinException in VehicleTest class.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- It is actually a set of simple association in this application. There is no improvement on association that can be made.
