# Auto Dealer Inventory Management System
# Language: Java

## The system that makes data visible
*Auto Dealer Inventory Management System* processes all information that auto dealers could use. 

It is mainly for **second-hand car dealers** to : 
- conveniently store inventory data
- show data analysis

This kind of project attracts me because of its wide usage and extendable complexity. It basically stores useful information but takes effort to make it handy for users.
